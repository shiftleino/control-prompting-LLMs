From this dataset, we will be using the stories written by the users to fine-tune GPT-2 to generate stories according to the sentiment given in the instruction. More specifically, in the fine-tuning and experiments stage we will utilize the following prompt: \"Continue the story with <|sentiment|> sentiment: <|story|>\", where <|sentiment|> is either \"positive\" or \"negative\" and <|story|> is a varying length start of a story from the WritingPrompts dataset.\n",

    "In  what follows, we use the [Hugging Face Tokenizer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/tokenizer) for tokenizing the train, validation, and test datasets. As we use GPT-2 (medium) as our language model, we will use the GPT2TokenizerFast. Underneath the class abstractions, OpenAI models utilize the [BPE (Byte pair encoding) algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding) in tokenizing the input texts for its models. For GPT-2, this encoding has a vocabulary size of 50,257 tokens. Before tokenizing, we have to also replace the special token of `<newline>` in the datasets to the standard `\\n` token indicating a new line in the text. We will also add a random (to avoid overfitting) instruction from a pre-defined instruction list for the model to continue the story as during the test time we will include in this instruction the control prompt of the desired sentiment for the story. In addition, we will truncate all the stories including the instruction prompt to 512 tokens as the RoBERTa-based sentiment classifier can only classify sequences up to 512 tokens (different encoding algorithm but ballpark is the same), thus making it unnecessary to fine-tune the GPT-2 to generate longer stories. Shorter sequences than 512 are padded with the `<|pad|>` token. We will omit the usage of `<|endoftext|>` and `<|startoftext|>` tokens as during the training we won't concatenate multiple stories together, thus each batch consists of individual stories with their instruction prompts prepended.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will utilize a custom PyTorch DataSet class for constructing the training and validation datasets, and the PyTorch DataLoader for enabling the batching (batch_size=16) and shuffling (shuffle=True) required by the mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. As the fine-tuning dataset is quite large (272,600 stories), we will tokenize the stories only after they are selected to the current mini-batch. Therefore, the tokenization is done in a custom collate function of the DataLoader to enable tokenizing the whole batch in one go."
